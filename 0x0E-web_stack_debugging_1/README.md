Feel free to install whatever tool you need, start and destroy as many containers as you need to debug the issue. Then, write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to automate your fix.

Requirements:

Nginx must be running, and listening on port 80 of all the server’s active IPv4 IPs
Write a Bash script that configures a server to the above requirements
